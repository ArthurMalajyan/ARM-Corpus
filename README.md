# Paraphrase-detection

Here are proposed Russian and Armenian paraphrases detection models. Which were obtained by fine-tuning [Deeppavlov's](http://deeppavlov.ai/) [RUBERT](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/master/features/models/bert.html) and [Google resarch's](https://github.com/google-research/bert?fbclid=IwAR2GSNQ7pwjglLqVGOB5PTxlMQ5SgWQZl4x5ZMlda5zArwxo4pp2Z6rp43g) [multilingual BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert?fbclid=IwAR2GSNQ7pwjglLqVGOB5PTxlMQ5SgWQZl4x5ZMlda5zArwxo4pp2Z6rp43g), accordingly.  


## Russian paraphrase detection model
It was created a new corpus for Russian paraphrase detection task, based on [KIELIPANKKI](https://korp.csc.fi/download/opusparcus/) "Open Subtitles Paraphrase Corpus". After that, the data was added  to [Paraphraser.ru](http://paraphraser.ru/) dataset, on which the RUBERT model was fine-tuned.

|Corpuses|Paraphraser.ru|Our data|Paraphraser.ru + Our data|
|  :---: |     :---:    | :---:  |          :---:          |
|Train   | 7202         |9364    |13609                    |
|Test    | 1899         |1855    |1899                     |

In some cases, all punctuation marks have been removed to understand how punctuation affects the efficiency of the model. Using the created corpuses, fine-tuning was made.

## Armenian paraphrase detection model
We provide a paraphrase detection model for Armenian sentences which obtains state-of-the-art result.

To train a model for Armenian language it was created paraphrase detection corpus, which did not exist beforeâ€¤ To create the dataset [Hetq](https://hetq.am/) and [Panarmenian](http://www.panarmenian.net/) news websites articles from the last 10 years were taken. In the initial step, the pairs of paraphrase sentences were obtained by comparing the sentences of the taken articles with each other and were selected, the sentences whose:

1. Overlap coefficient >= 0.5.
2. levenshtein distance <= 50.
3. The number of words in a sentence is greater than 6 and less than 22.

At the next step the selected sentences were translated from Armenian to English and vise versa. After which the obtained sentences pairs were labeled by linguists.

|number of examples|all|strict paraphrases|non-paraphrases|loose paraphrases|
|  :---: |     :---:    | :---:  |          :---:          | :---:  |
|Train   | 4233         |1339   |2684               | 210 |
|Test    | 2325         |1021   |448                  | 213 |

The created test set was translated to Russian and English to test the results on Paraphraser.ru Train and [MRPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52398) Train. Also Paraphraser.ru and MRPC train sets were translated into Armenian.
